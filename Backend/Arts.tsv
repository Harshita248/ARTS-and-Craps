Name	Materials	Instructions
Sharpie Tie Dye	"Sharpie Markers in Blue, Red, And Yellow I recommend using a light blue! The dark blue doesn’t mix as well with other colors.
    Plain White T-shirts  or T- shirt fabric
    Large Embroidery Hoop (10-Inch)
    Eye Droppers 
    Plate
    Small Bowl
    70% Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol
    Retayne (optional for making it colorfast)"	"    Step One Use the embroidery hoop to tighten a section of fabric at the front of the shirt
    Step Two Use your red, yellow, and blue Sharpies to draw all over the shirt. Add a good layer of color. For the best color mixing demonstration you can use bull’s-eye designs with alternating red, yellow, and blue circles.
    Step Three When the design is complete, slip a plate inside the shirt under the embroidery hoop to catch any rubbing alcohol that may seep through.
    Step Four Pour rubbing alcohol into a small bowl. Using an eye dropper begin dropping rubbing alcohol on the t-shirt. If you have bull’s-eye designs drop the alcohol in the center of each bull’s-eye. Within seconds you will see more colors appear! Green, orange and purple should be visible as the ink bleeds and mixes with the other colors.
    Step Five Get that t-shirt really saturated! Alternatively use the rubbing alcohol in a controlled manner to bleed and blend only certain parts of the shirt. Now let dry.
    Step Six Once it’s dry remove the embroidery hoop and iron your shirt."
Color Theory Candy	"Red, Blue, and Yellow Candy Melts
    Muffin Tin– for mixing only
    Craft Sticks
    Candy Mold- we used this one available at craft stores for a couple dollars.
    Spoons"	"    Step One Melt the candy following the directions on the bag. We melted ours in the microwave but if you don’t have a microwave you can melt them over a double boiler.
    Step Two Place the melted candy next to the muffin tin and candy molds. Ask your child to add a spoonful of two primary colors to one of the muffin cups and stir using a craft stick to create a secondary color.
    Step Three When your color is mixed use the craft stick to transfer some of the melted candy to the candy mold.
    Step Four Repeat to make different colors. Don’t forget to make a few candies from your unmixed primary colors!
    Step Five When the candy mold is filled, take a craft stick and scrape the excess candy off the top of the mold.
    Step Six Place in the refrigerator to cool. This should take about 15-30 minutes
    Step Seven Once cooled, pop them out and enjoy!"
Stained Glass Pasta	"    Flat Pasta Lasagne

    Painter’s Tape
    Black Sharpies- This type of tip works best"	"    Step One Break your lasagna noodles into pieces. There should be a variety of sizes.
    Step Two Color your pasta according to the tutorial above.
    Step Three Cut out two matching sizes of clear contact paper, ours were roughly 10” x 10”.
    Step Four Remove the backing from one piece of contact paper and tape it your work surface using painter’s tae. The sticky side should be facing UP.
    Step Five Have your child place pieces of the colored lasagna on the contact paper. They can custom break pieces as necessary. Leave at least  1/4″ gaps between the pieces. You may want to show them some examples of stained glass to illustrate why.
    Step Six Remove the backing from the second piece of contact paper and gently place it on top of the finished layout. Gently burnish the gaps with your fingertips to seal.
    Step Seven Using a wide tip Sharpie, fill in the gap between the colored pieces with black for a stained glass effect."
Shibori Fabric	"
    Rit Indigo Shibori Tie Dye Kit
    (2) 9"" x 7"" rectangles of 100% cotton fabric
    (2) Pieces of 1/4 inch elastic cut to 6.5 inches
    Plastic Container
    Binder Clips
    Salt
    Measuring Cup
    Plastic Table Cover
    Paper Towels
    Sewing Machine/Thread
    Rit ColorStay Dye Fixative"	"
    Cover work area with plastic table cover and have paper towels handy to protect against any possible spills.
    Wet fabric.
    To create a traditional Itajime pattern, accordion fold or “fan fold"" the fabric in 4 1/2"" wide folds down the length of the fabric. This will form a long rectangle. For more pattern variations, vary the size and width of the folds.
    Accordion fold or “fan fold"" the long rectangle into a 4 1/2"" fabric square.
    Sandwich the fabric square between the 4"" blocks of wood.
    Secure “sandwich"" with rubber bands to tightly hold the fabric square together.
    Fill a plastic container with 1.5 gallons of very hot water. The water should ideally be 140ºF. If tap water is not hot enough, heat water on the stove and add to the dye bath.
    To enhance the color add one cup of salt. Add 1 teaspoon of dish detergent to help promote level dyeing. Stir well.
    Wearing rubber gloves, add 1/4 cup of well-shaken Indigo dye to dye bath.
    Add sandwiched fabric to dye bath. For a high contrast pattern, keep the sandwiched fabric in the dye bath for about 3 to 5 minutes to keep the wrapped part dye-free. For more color and less white areas, leave the wrapped fabric set in the dye bath for 10 to 20 minutes.
    When desired color is achieved, remove wrapped fabric from the dye bath. Do not remove wood blocks.
    We strongly recommend using Rit ColorStay Dye Fixative immediately after dyeing and before washing. It enhances the color, increases color retention and prevents dye from bleeding into white areas. Follow package instructions.
    Rinse in cool water until rinse water begins to run clear.
    Carefully remove wood blocks and rubber bands. Unfold the fabric.
    Wash in warm water with a mild detergent, rinse and dry."

    Repeat with as many colors as you like. In a single cup, combine the desired colors one at a time.
    Prepare a cooling rack and place the dried white rocks on top. Add a piece of watercolor paper below the rack to catch the paint drippings.
    Pour the paint on top of the rock, adding multiple layers if desired.
    Dry for 24 hours."
Red Heart Fishnet Jars	"RED HEART Scrubby

Smoothie™: 1 ball 9205 Aqua or 9341 Grey

Mason jar, ruler, scissors, superglue, paperclip (Fringe version only)

GAUGE: Gauge is not critical for this project.

JARS"	"1. Measure the height of the jar. Cut 12 lengths of yarn 4 times the height of the jar.

2. Cut 1 length of yarn twice the size of the jar mouth circumference.

3. Fold the longer lengths in half. Tie each long length evenly across the shorter length, leaving space on both ends to tie to the mouth of the jar.

4. Tie the shorter length around the jar mouth and knot securely.

5. Starting on one end, tie and knot the long lengths in pairs 1"" (2.54 cm) below the jar mouth. You should have 6 knots total.

6. Tie and knot the doubled long lengths in pairs 1"" (2.54 cm) below the last knots, this time tying lengths together to form diamonds all the way around the jar.

7. Tie and knot the doubled long lengths in pairs 1"" (2.54 cm) below the last knots, this time tying the strands in pairs as you did in Step 5.

8. Repeat steps 6-7, alternating which strands you knot, until you reach the bottom edge of the jar.

FINISHING

Superglue a yarn tail to the jar mouth, then wrap yarn around the jar several times. Cut and superglue yarn end to secure.

Choose one of the following options:

Option 1: Fringe

When finished knotting around the jar, trim tails to about 1"" (2.5 cm). Use an unfolded paperclip to brush through the fringe ends, breaking apart the plies and making the fringe fluffier. Trim ends as needed.

Option 2: Net

Repeat steps 6-7 to work another round of knots as established. Flip jar upside down and pull all yarn to the center. Knot and superglue yarn ends to the bottom of the jar."

Slime	"bowls 
¼ cup of white school glue.  
½ tbs Borax  the consistency you want.
1 cup of water
food coloring (Optional)
re-sealable plastic bag "	"In one of the bowls, mix ¼ cup of water and ¼ cup of white school glue. If you would like colored slime, add a few drops of food coloring to the solution.

In another bowl, mix ½ tbs Borax with ½ a cup of water and stir until the borax has dissolved.

Add the borax solution to the glue solution and mix. You can also pour the solutions into a re-sealable plastic bag and mix.

A slime-like texture should begin to form immediately. Continue to stir and knead until you get the consistency you want.

Remove your slime from the bowl (or bag) and enjoy."
Lava Lamp	A wide bottle (or a fancy drinking glass or wide glass vase), food coloring, vegetable oil, water, and an Alka-seltzer tablet.	"Step 1: The Oil

Fill the container about 3/4 with vegetable oil. You can choose the size of the container based on how much vegetable oil you have to spare.

Step 2: The Water

Fill the rest of the container with water, leaving 2-3 inches at the top. Watch the water fall through the vegetable oil and settle at the bottom. Can you believe that water is more dense than oil? Water molecules are ""polar"" and oil molecules are ""non-polar"", so they are not attracted to each other in the least. 

Step 3: The Color

What color would you like the ""lava"" in your lava lamp to be? After the water has settled for a minute or so, add you food coloring. We added about 10 drops. Watch as each drop falls through the oil and sits on top of the water layer. Wait until all of the water droplets break through the oil/water line and burst into the water. 

Step 4: The Bubbles

Drop your Alka-seltzer tablet in and let the games begin! The Alka-seltzer water reaction produces carbon dioxide gas bubbles which stick to the water droplets. The water/gas combo is less dense than the vegetable oil, so they rise to the top. The gas bubbles then break and are released into the air and the water sinks back down to the bottom to start over again! "
Levitating Orb	"
    1 inch (2.5 cm) wide PVC Pipe about 24 inches (60cm) long. You can also use a regular balloon if you do not have PVC pipe.
    Mylar tinsel for Christmas trees. There are many types of tinsel and many will not work – you should look for the thinnest and narrowest possible. 
    A head of clean, dry hair
    Scissors"	"
    Arrange 6 strands of mylar together and tie them together in a knot at one end.
    Tie them together again about 6 inches (15cm) from the first knot.
    Cut the loose mylar strands off just past each knot.
    Charge the PVC pipe by rubbing it back and forth through your hair for 10 seconds.
    Hold the mylar orb (by the knot) above the charged pipe and let it drop and touch the pipe.
    It should repel away and start floating. If the tinsel keeps sticking to the pipe, the tinsel is probably not thin enough and you will need to try another kind of tinsel or order some from us. (You will usually have to “recharge” the pipe before each levitation.)"
